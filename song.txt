I'm on a sugar crash, I ain't got no fuckin' cash
Maybe I should take a bath, cut my fuckin' brain in half
I'm not lonely, just a bit tired of this fucking shit
Nothing that I write can make me feel good

I'm on a sugar crash, I ain't got no fuckin' cash
Maybe I should take a bath, cut my fuckin' brain in half
I'm not lonely, just a bit tired of this fucking shit
Nothing that I write can make me feel good
